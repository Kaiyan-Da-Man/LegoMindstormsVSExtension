# Mind_Reader
The current editor options available lack the level of accessibility that is
required to allow students who are visually impaired to adequately edit, write,
and debug code. This tool would extend Visual Studio Codeâ€™s existing
accessibility options to allow everyone, primarily students K-12, to learn
programming with Lego Mindstorms. Our goal is to provide an enhanced experience
for students who are visually impaired that is transparent to sighted students.
This allows for everyone to use the same software solution, whether or not they
are vision impaired.
